### Overview of Project
This project analyzes the Kickstarter Campaign data to uncover trends in relation to the launch date and the funding goals for plays. The report includes visualized campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.The purpose of this project is to provide an analysis to Louise so she can decide the best time of the year and the funding goal to establish for her next campaign.

### Analysis and Challenges
I performed this analysis using pivot charts, pivot tables, and vba code. I encountered a minor challenge with basic syntax errors but was able to overcome the challenge by reviewing the module material again.



### Results
Based on "Outcomes based on LAUNCH DATE" tables and charts, we can determine the following:

	1. Very few (no more than 7) of the Plays in the Kickstarter Campaigns were canceled

	2. May and June launched the most successful campaigns. 
	
	3. May, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.
	



Based on "Outcomes based on GOALS" tables amd charts, we can determine the following:
	
	1.Plays with a funding goal $5000 or less were the most successful
	


### Summary of the limitations of the dataset
I found no limitations to the dataset.

### Recommendation for additional tables or graphs 
The tables and graphs were sufficient for this analsis.
