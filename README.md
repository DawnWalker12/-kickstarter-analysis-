#### Analysis and Challenges
I performed this analysis using pivot charts,pivot tables, and vba code.I encountered challenges with basic syntex errors but was able to overcome the challenge by reviewing the module material again.


#### Results
Based on Outcomes based on Launch Date, we can determine the following:
	1. None of the Plays in Kickstarter Campaigns were canceled.
	2. May and June were the most successful months. 
	

Based on Outcomes based on Goals, we can determine the following:
1.


The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart. As you hover over each point with your mouse pointer, a tooltip appears with the corresponding information.

#### Summary of the limitations of the dataset

#### Recommendation for additional tables or graphs
